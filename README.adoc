= Terraform Jenkins Module

Jenkins is a bit special since we are using two accounts at the same time:
- US account: ECS and rest
- SG account: Route 53

This is what you have to set:
export TF_VAR_route53_account_access_key=[your SG access key]
export TF_VAR_route53_account_secret_key=[your SG secret key]

RUN: AWS_PROFILE=us terraform plan
i.e. using the AWS US profile for all resources, but use SG for Route 53
